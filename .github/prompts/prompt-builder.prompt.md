This interactive prompt helps create production-ready `.prompt.md` files tailored to Java and object-oriented projects.

It follows the same discovery sections as the original and emphasizes:
- JUnit 5 testing patterns
- Maven project structure
- Java coding conventions and exception handling

Use it to generate new prompt files under `.github/prompts/` and update `ai-manifest.md` accordingly.
